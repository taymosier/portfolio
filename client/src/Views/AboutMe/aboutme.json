I have built full stack applications in the past; both front-end and back-end positions are suitable. As a self-taught developer coming from a business/marketing background, I hope to find a mentor who will point out the weak areas of my technical knowledge."

Using a combination of textbooks, online courses, and practice problems and projects, I believe I have gained a solid foundational knowledge of computer programming in general and of web development in particular. Following graduating from college, I was able to pursue my studies more earnestly after taking a bartending position that allowed for a large amount of flexibility in my schedule. "

        "body": "I took on a data analyst position at a law firm subsidiary company, where I investigated information systems compromised by bad actors. My main responsibilities involved identifying what types of personal information were contained in the compromised data and who was affected. This required critical interpretation of information in the context of business, financial, legal, medical, technological, and educational information systems. I left on amicable terms with the company due to a lack of consistent work and my freelance work requiring an increasing amount of my time."

Over the course of two and a half years, I took on more and more responsibilities to the point where I often had my manager's keys more often than he did. I left on excellent terms with the company when my girlfirend took a promotion with her company that required moving to Raleigh, NC. This position was critical to developing my programming abilities, as it allowed me to commit considerably more time to study than would have otherwise been possible in a more traditional position."
